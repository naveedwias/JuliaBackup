# Point Evaluators

Point evaluators allow to evaluate the Solution at arbitrary points.

```@autodocs
Modules = [GradientRobustMultiPhysics]
Pages = ["pointevaluator.jl"]
Order   = [:type, :function]
```

#### Noteworthy Examples

Example 224 uses PointEvaluator to evaluate the pressure difference in a flow around an obstacle and to offer a callback function for a quiver plot.
